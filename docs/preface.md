# Preface

<star />

## Welcome to my interview guide!

I'm [Sourav Bandyopadhyay](https://github.com/SouravBandyopadhyay), a Software Developer.
 <!-- Over the years, I've experienced around 100 software engineering interviews from both perspectives&mdash;as an interviewee and as an interviewer. I've successfully navigated interviews at major tech firms, including FAANG companies, as well as smaller startups. -->

This guide aims to document my structured interview preparation process to benefit the broader software development community.

## Target audience

This guide is designed for both new and seasoned software engineering candidates, focusing on individual contributor (IC) roles rather than engineering management positions. While some sections may still be useful for those interviewing for management roles, much of the content is tailored for IC candidates.

## Goals and non-goals

Many excellent resources are available, but they often cover so much ground that they can be overwhelming. My goal is to provide a specific, actionable interview preparation process based on my personal approach. It may not suit everyone, and that's perfectly fine! If my method resonates with you, I hope this guide proves to be very practical.

**Goals:**

- Offer a clear and actionable methodology
- Be concise and easy to understand
- Focus on process and strategy

**Non-goals:**

- Exhaustively list every possible resource
- Match the depth and breadth of other comprehensive guides
- Cover adjacent topics such as job search strategies or salary negotiations

## How to read this guide

This guide isn't very lengthy, so I recommend reading it straight through initially. Since it is intentionally opinionated, you might find that some approaches don't suit you, which is completely fine.

Many concepts are designed to be memorable upon first reading. During your preparation, refer back to the relevant sections as needed to reinforce your understanding.
